            <h2>Interesting Things</h2>
            <p>
                I wouldn't consider my self as an intersting guy, however there are some interesing things about
                me I wouldnt mind sharing.

                I find phones really interesting. A few years ago, I was looking to buy a new phone. So naturally,
                I began to conduct some research about phones... a lot of research. I stumbled on an entire YouTube
                community of smartphone reviewers and tech reviewers in general. I'm not sure exactly what I found
                so interesting about it; but since then, I've always kept up with the new phones that were coming
                and often find myself getting excited abou the new iPhone even though I know I'm not going to get it.
                A few years ago, I had the Samsung Galaxy Grand. I always dislked the phone for performance issues.
                After doing some research about how to ease the performance issues, I stumbled upon another community
                if custom ROMS. Even though I didnt entirely know what I was doing, I customized and recustomized my
                phone many times. I just found it exciting.

            <h2>Soccer</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, I'm giving soccer its own paragraph. Why? because its awesome. I've been playing soccer for
                a while now, but I began playing for my school in the 10th grade and I've been playing for my
                schools ever since. Unfortunatly, my university does not have an official soccer team, I'm part
                of a soccer club. We run practices and occationally play skimage matches against other universities.

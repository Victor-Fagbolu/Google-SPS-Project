            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                As far as backgrounds go, mine is quite complex. For starters, my first name is 
                Oluwasegun, I go by Victor because many people find it difficult to pronounce it. 
                I was born in Lagos, Nigeria, but have lived in the United States most of my life. 
                I currently live in Missouri City. My family moved often, and due to this, I 
                attended three different High Schools. This experience helped me to be able to better 
                adapt to new environments and situations.

            <h2>School</h2>
            <p>
                I currently a rising junior at Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas. 
                I major in computer science. My reson for choosing computer science is quite strange
                and some may say it's reckless. Growing up, I was always good at math, and for most of
                high school, I thought I would major in math. It wasn't until I was completing the college
                application that I change my mind and decided to go with computer science. In fact, I
                applied to a different school previously and was going to major in math, but decided not to 
                go to that school for a seprate reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of that last minute decision I find myself at a place right now in my life where
                I know for a certain that I could not be happier doing anything else. I completely fell in 
                love with coding and computer science in general. The only thing I would have done differently
                is to begin studying computer science in highschool.

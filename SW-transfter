What is the point of Ms. Moore’s lesson? Why does Sylvia resist it?
The point of Ms. Moore’s lesson is to illustrate to the children the wealth is disproportionately distributed in the society and encourage them to take action and be proactive in this matter. 
Ms. Moore takes them to the FAO Schwarz Toy Store in a fancier part of the town. They observe items clearly priced for people in a significantly higher wealth gap. The purpose of this was that they begin to contemplate why some people could afford to pay what they perceived as outstanding prices for seemingly unnecessary items, where that money could provide them food for a whole year. In the story, Ms. Moore says “Where we are is who we are. . . But it don’t necessarily have to be that way”. From this the reader can infer that the lesson from the story as well as Ms. Moore’s other lessons are not just for the children to experience and contemplate, but to encourage them to take action to change their circumstance.
There can be many ways to interpret the reasons why Sylvia resists her lessons, but in my opinion, I believe she resists the lesson because she is naive and contemptuous. From the beginning we know she has a negative opinion about people. She describes most people as “old and stupid or young and foolish” With this notion, its not surprising that she has at least some resistance to lessons from Ms. Moore.

Solution #4: Citizen assisted crash reporting
Sometimes crash scenes can be standard; however, many times crash reports contain so many variables that by the time the officer gets to the scene, some variables may have changed. For example, if one driver leaves the scene, valuable information that could have been used to show how the crash occurred would be lost.
For this solution we will build an IOS, Android, and web application that will allow the user to enter the information necessary to complete the physical crash report form. As with solution#1, the application would provide optimizations such as weather, and GPS location services. Sensitive data acquired from the DPS database will not be displayed to the user and will only be associated upon form upload.
Our software will be able to associate several reports from the same using reports with similar location data as well as similar variables such as driver information and vehicle information. At the station, these citizen reports can be pulled up using various searchable from the forms. Similar forms will also be pulled up. The similar reports can then be combined into one.
This solution ensures data accuracy by diversifying the sources of information.

Solution #5
Some say a picture is worth a thousand words. And when an officer is spending valuable time filling pages and pages of crash report variables, we believe that a picture and video accompaniment can go a long way to bypass a good amount of data that has to be entered.
This solution takes full advantage of video capable devices to gather information from the crash site quicker and easier. If we look at the crash report (Figure X.X), we see multiple fields where the officer provides descriptions of what the scene looks like. These fields include “extent of damage”, “damage areas”, “direction of travel”, “manner of collision” and “vehicle diagram”. These fields and many more could easily be replaced with a video attachment.
This application is compatible with video capable devices. It will contain a shortened version of the form similar to solution #1 that the user is able to fill any time during the reporting process. The main feature, however, is the video capability. The user can capture the scene using a simple picture or a video. Then the video is submitted the video file is stored along with the short manually filled form that accompanies it. At the station, this can be stored in the database as the complete collation of the report or the video can be analyzed to complete the form formally.
